I started by creating a pairplot to identify anything strange or noticable relationships. Year seems to have an exponential relationship with the target, while budget and runtime look more or less linear. However, the ratings show large gaps in relation to the target. After scoring my train and validation data, I found that the train score was much larger than my validation score. This means tthe model is most likely overfitting the data. To verify this, I created a simple linear regressions plot using matplotlib. It was clear that my model is too complex and requires more constraints.
