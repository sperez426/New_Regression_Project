## Regression Project

The purpose of this project is to predict the opening gross of Disney's new movie, Cruella. The gross opening weekend is crucial to the success of a movie and typically makes up about a third of the movie's entire domestic gross. To begin my analysis, I will use 'get' requests to retrieve the pages of the top lifetime gross movies with a PG-13 rating from Box Office Mojo. Next I will use Beautiful Soup to parse the data in order to distinguish the movies and their features as well as add it into a list of dictionaries. Additionally I plan to scrape IMBD, using selenium, for the user ratings and number of users for each movie and add this to my dictionary. The list of dictionaries will be converted into a dataframe which I plan to store in an SQL database after cleaning the data. To clean the data, I will use pandas to take care of any null values, convert data types, and create dummy variables for the categorical features. Next using Scikit-learn, I will create test and train data so that I can compare different regression models to identify which model best fits my data.  Once a model has been chosen, I will try to improve the fit of my model through the addition and the removal of features, as well as, the creation of polynomial features and interaction terms. I expect to work with the following features: genre, seasons, director, run time, opening gross, number of theaters, box office gross, release date, year, budget, distributor, rating, and numer of users. Finally I will calculate RMSE value and review the coefficients to determine how well my model predictions are. To visualize my regression model and the residuals, I will use seaborn. The results of my analysis will allow me to give the producers a prediction of the opening gross of Cruella, which could help them determine a reasonable budget range and give them an idea of the success of their movie.
